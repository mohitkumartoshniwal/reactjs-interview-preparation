# Server Driven UI

Quite a useful pattern where the server is responsible and controls what is shown to the user as part of the UI.
A simple example is added here. A video explanation can be found in my [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edUIN0NgwYE)

## Instruction

Run the example by running below commands in separate terminals

```
npm run dev
npm run server
```
